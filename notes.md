##Study and development notes

###Todo:


- Tab support (W3 requirement)

Let use tab to the wrapper element, but don't let user in to avoid user having to tab who knows how many times to get out of the slider.

Instead, when tab focus is detected on input, display two new buttons bellow the wrapper that user can use to navigate to element they desire


- color configuration

Allow color configuration with css styles through props

- message configuration

allow configuration for custom message for default element

- elements to display

allow for passing of elements and configuration for array with object elements

- default element

pass default element

- native select support

- arguments for and against these kind of sliders for this situation
